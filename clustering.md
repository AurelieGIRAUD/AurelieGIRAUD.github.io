This project includes the following steps:

1. Data Wrangling

- Data Cleaning
- Handling outliers
- Dealing with missing values
- Check correlations and distributions
- Log-transformation

2. Segmentation

- Preprocessing: normalization, tuning,...
- Select most important features to highlight the key criteria to segment the customers.
- Clustering with various ML algorithms: K-Means, SpectralClustering, AgglomerativeClustering, DBSCAN and K-Medoid.
- Visualization of cluster's characterictics to understand the typology of customers.
- Cluster Analysis based on distance between the centroids and statistical tests (Mann-Whitney) to check if all clusters are significant.
