  Data Scientist | Analytics & Visualization 
  <br><br>
  Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lily, data scientist and mom of an adorable little girl - on a journey to find a balance between achievement and fulfillment. 
  Born and raise in France and living now my dream in Denmark. 
  I discovered a passion for Statistics and Experimental Design during my academic education in Biology: Framing a problem and testing hypothesis were at that time, at the core of my interest.
  Then I spent several years of my early career as an engineer and project manager for different industries - mainly focused on reducing the human impact on our planet. 
  It has been a fascinating experience, which taught me a lot about how businesses work and how to communicate with stakeholders from very different background.
  Ultimately I realized that I wanted to make a living of the 30% of my day-to-day tasks that consist of analyzing data and design model-based solution.
  And here started my journey for becoming Data Scientist!
  With a clear goal in mind and a strong determination, I spent the next 2 years learning programming, machine learning and honing some essentials my soft skills 
  - like critical/analytical thinking, communication and adaptability among others.
  
  Today, I get the most joy from making real business impact based on data, analytics, and automation. 
  I love to create compelling visualization and aspire to become a Data storyteller as I believe it is essential to share across functions and support the whole organization to thrive. 
  Writing articles and blog posts are one of my favorite way to reinforce my learning process and share my passion.
