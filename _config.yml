  Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lily, <br>
  Data Scientist, aspiring storyteller, and writer - on a mission to democratize Analytics.
  It all started during my Master's degree when I discovered a passion for Statistics and Experimental Design. 
  Shortly after - as a project manager, I learned how businesses work and how to communicate with stakeholders from disparate backgrounds. 
  Ultimately I realized that I get the most joy from making a business impact based on data, analytics, and automation. 
  From there, I decided to drop everything and start over to become a Data Scientist.
  Today, when I'm not coding, you can find me writing blogs on how to apply Data Science to solve business challenges and self-growth.
