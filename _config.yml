  I get the most joy from making real business impact based on data, analytics, and automation. 
  I love to create compelling visualization and aspire to become a Data storyteller as I believe it is essential to share across functions and support the whole organization to thrive.

  Always looking for new opportunities to expand my World, I'm on a journey to find a balance between achievement and fulfillment. This means that I'm continuously researching for improving both my technical and soft skills. As a self-learner, I'd love nothing more than to tackle a business problem - using data gathering, manipulation, visualization, machine learning model development, forecasting, and reporting. Writing articles and blog posts are another way to reinforce my learning process and share my passion.
