  Data Scientist | Analytics & Visualization 
  <br><br>
  Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lily, <br>
  Data scientist and mom of an adorable little girl - on a journey to find a balance between achievement and fulfillment. I was born and raised in France and living now my dream in Denmark. <br>
  I discovered a passion for Statistics and Experimental Design during my academic education in Biology: Framing a problem and testing hypotheses were at that time, at the core of my interest. 
  I then spent several years of my early career as an engineer and project manager which taught me a lot about how businesses work and how to communicate with stakeholders from very different backgrounds. <br>
  Ultimately I realized that I get the most joy from making a business impact based on data, analytics, and automation. And here started my journey to becoming Data Scientist! <br>
  When I'm not coding, you can find me in a cozy danish cafe writing articles and blog posts about how to use Data Science to solve real-life business cases and self-development.
