  Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lily, <br>
  Data Scientist, mom of an adorable girl and social coffee addict - on a mission to democratize Analytics and shape better products!
  It all started during my Master degree when I discovered a passion for Statistics and Experimental Design. 
  Shortly after - as a project manager, I learned how businesses work and how to communicate with stakeholders from disparate backgrounds. 
  Ultimately I realized that I get the most joy from making a business impact based on data, analytics, and automation. 
  This is when I decided to drop everything and start over, for becoming a Data Scientist.
  When I'm not coding, you can find me writing blogs on how to use Data Science to solve real-life business cases and self-development.
