# Detect counterfeit banknotes with logistic regression

### âœ… Business Case

In this project, we are creating a model to detect fake banknotes using a Logistic Regression algorithm and labelled data containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes. 


### ðŸ“‰ Dataset

This project was completed as a part of the [Data Analyst nanodegree](https://openclassrooms.com/en/dashboard/paths) displayed by Openclassrooms. 
The dataset is therefore provided by the platform as a part of the program.

### ðŸ“’ Repository
The repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Logistic_Regression). It describes how to apply a Logistic Regression Model using the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
  - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. 
  - Handling outliers
  - Data Visualizations supported by MatplotLib.
  
 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
  - Scree Plot Analysis.
  - Loadings Plots.
  - Scores Plots.
  - Selection of the principal components.
  
 3. Logistic Regression
  
  - Train and Apply a logistic regression model to detect fake banknotes using their dimensions.
  - Performances Analysis.


### ðŸŽ¯ Key take-away

We start the analytic by evaluating the diversity of income across a selection of 5 countries, using the Lorenz curve and Gini Index. The following distribution highlight the broad range of incomes among the selection:

1. Lorenz curve

The Lorenz concentration curve is a way to represent the distribution function of a variable X. It is used in particular in economics to measure inequalities in the possession of wealth. We will use it here to assess inequalities in terms of the distribution of incomes among the group of countries selected.

```python
def lorenz_curve(X):
    lorenz = np.cumsum(np.sort(X['income'])) / X['income'].sum()
    lorenz = np.append([0],lorenz) 
```

âœ… The furthest the Lorenz curve is from the first bisector line, the more inequalities of revenue in the given country. We can see here that there are more inequalities in Argentina than in Denmark.

3. Gini Index

The Gini index represents the area between the Lorenz curve and the first bisector line. It is a good metric to summarize the information from the Lorenz curve.


The smallest the Gini Index The least inequalities in the Country. Here we see:

Denmark and Iceland are the countries with the least inequalities among the selection of countries. In 2011, they tend to have more or less the same index. The Index increase slightly in Denmark between 2008 and 2011 and while it decreased strongly in Iceland.
Georgia and Turkey have in 2011 an index about 1.5 time bigger than the index of Denmark and Iceland. The index stayed relatively stable since 2007.
Argentina is the country with the biggest inequalities in terms of income among its population. Its index is the highest of the selection. However, we can see that it tends to decrease since 2004 and is almost at the same level of Georgia and Turkey in 2011.
We are now looking at all the countries in the World and ranking them by gini index ascending so from the country with the less inequality of incomes to the country with the biggest inequalities
