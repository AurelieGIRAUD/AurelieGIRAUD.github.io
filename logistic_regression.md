# Detect counterfeit banknotes with logistic regression

### ✅ Business Case

In this project, we are creating a model to detect fake banknotes using a Logistic Regression algorithm and labelled data containing the characteristics of genuine banknotes. 


### 📉 Dataset

This project was completed as a part of the [Data Analyst nanodegree](https://openclassrooms.com/en/dashboard/paths) displayed by Openclassrooms. 
The dataset is therefore provided by the platform as a part of the program.

### 📒 Repository
The repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AurelieGIRAUD/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/Logistic_Regression). It describes how to apply a Logistic Regression Model using the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
  - Univariate and Bivariate Analysis. 
  - Handling outliers
  - Data Visualizations supported by MatplotLib.
  
 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
  - Scree Plot Analysis.
  - Loadings Plots.
  - Scores Plots.
  - Selection of the principal components.
  
 3. Logistic Regression
  
  - Train and Apply a logistic regression model to detect fake banknotes using their dimensions.
  - Performances Analysis.


### 🎯 Key take-away

We start the analytic by evaluating the diversity of income across a selection of 5 countries, using the Lorenz curve and Gini Index. The following distribution highlight the broad range of incomes among the selection:

1. Lorenz curve

```python
def lorenz_curve(X):
    lorenz = np.cumsum(np.sort(X['income'])) / X['income'].sum()
    lorenz = np.append([0],lorenz) 
``` 
3. Gini Index
